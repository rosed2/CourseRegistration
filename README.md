# UIUC Course Registration

## Project Overview  
This project lets UIUC students register for their desired classes in an automated way.   

## Usage Notes    
The code requires selenium, Google Chrome, selenium's webdriver for your specific web browser, and bs4. Install using pip or other preferred python installation method.    
Provide your UIUC account login information in the file "loginInfo.txt", with just your nedId on the first line and just your password on the second line.   
Provide the CRN's of the classes you want to register for in the file "crns.txt", with each CRN on its own line.    
To use this code, download the repository, cd into the folder, and run the python file “code.py”.
